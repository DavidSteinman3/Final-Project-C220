This game was developed as a final project for C220 as part of a 48-hour game jam. 

When we considered the theme of 'corona', we thought about it this way: 
Coronavirus has certainly scared a huge portion of the worlds population, with many comparing the pandemic to post-apocalyptic movies and other media. This game tells the story of how the Coronavirus mutated into a virus that also turns people into flesh eating zombies and now it's up to a lone survivor to rid his home of infected people around the island he lives on.

These are the struggles and surprises we encountered as we developed it: 
Creating an animation for the gun to shoot, since we did not use bullets and instead used raycasts to kill the zombies, it was hard creating a realistic animation for the gun shooting bullets, also UI was difficult to coordinate with the camera that followed the player. Additionally, coding the zombies relation to the players score and health was a challenge that our team faced.

These are the technologies and resources we used: 
Technologies: Godot, Adobe Photoshop, Resources: Top-Down shooter tileset for the terrain & Horror City tileset for the buildings

This is the objective of the game: 
Explore the map and the seven different locations(Downtown, Beach, Docks, Race Track, Estates, Forest, & Junkyard) that the player can travel to while killing as many zombies as possible (60 zombies total spread out across map), without letting the zombies get too close to the player.

This is how the game is played: Move around using either the arrow keys or W,S,A,D while using the mouse to aim the players gun, press the spacebar to fire the players gun.

Future plans: Perhaps expand the map and make it bigger. Deadlines made it so we had to work rather quickly, but in the future we could continue this project by having a bigger map with more enemies and maybe collectables to find hidden across the map.
